# Pairing From Lone Ranger to Collaborator

## Abstract
When it comes to Developer Burnout there are no silver bullets, each developer’s experience calls for a tailored remedy; This is what worked for me.

When the time came for me to face my burnout, I decided to hang up my cowboy boots.
But that didn’t have to mean the end of a career, instead I chose to go from lone ranger to collaborator.

In this talk we will take a look at how a collaborative environment of Pair Programming, Shared Ownership and Mentorship can boost a personal sense of accomplishment, help foster trust and psychological safety throughout a team and reignite a passion for development.

## Pitch
I've been a developer for almost two decades and recently I almost dropped out of the industry due to burnout. I want to share my experience with others on how that happened, how collaboration helped me get past it and most of all practical steps the audience can adopt in their own workplaces to collaborate better.

I'll touch on Pair Programming & shared ownership, the effects they have on  psychological safety, on encouraging a more diverse workplace and on mentorship.
