## Pairing From Burnout To Vigor

# Abstract
When it comes to Developer Burnout there are no silver bullets, each developer’s experience calls for a tailored remedy.

In this talk we will take a look at how an environment of Pair Programming, Shared Ownership and Mentorship can boost a personal sense of accomplishment, foster trust throughout a team and reignite a career.
