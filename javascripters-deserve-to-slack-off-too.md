# Javascripters Deserve to Slack Off Too

## Abstract
For a generation developers have enjoyed the #1 excuse for legitimately slacking off: “My code’s compiling” (just ask XKCD *), I think it’s time we had this excuse too.

With the rise of Babel as an industry standard, the door has opened to bolstering our toolchain with compile time tooling, both generalised and project specific.

In this talk we’ll look into how we can use Babel to build developer tooling for our daily use, how we can use it to explore new approaches to code writing and how we too can enjoy the advantages of compile time.
