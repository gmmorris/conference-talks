#  When The Function Is Ready, The Composability Will Appear — Zen Proverb

## Abstract
The elders had a saying, “Favour Object Composition over inheritance”, but for me, hearing the words was one thing and undertsanding them quite another.
As we gravitate closer to functional programming, the subject of composition is often presented to us as something we should be striving for over Object Oriented paradigms, but how on earth do we achieve this with the complex code we're actually authoring?
No, it isn’t just in your head, composition truly is far from intuitive and until recently, I couldn’t quite wrap my brain around how to achieve it either.

In my talk we’ll discuss the very thing that makes it possible to compose different pieces of code together, the `composability` attribute, how it’s achieved and how to use it to our advantage.
We’ll use the magical art of simple mathematic substitution, and some JS know how, to show that Object Composition is actually already within your reach.
We’ll touch on today's tooling for writing composable code and hopefully I’ll inspire you to lead the way towards the composability tools of tomorrow.

## Pitch
Composable code can empower developers by promoting more testable, reusable and maintainbale code. The key to writing composable code is to understand what _it is_ that makes code composable in the first place and then how to use it.
This is very important topic that can elevate developers from hearing to words to actually understanding them and then applying them.
