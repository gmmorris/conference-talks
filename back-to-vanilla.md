# Back to Vanilla

## Abstract
A while back my company asked me to rotate out of a React project in order to work on an older codebase in plain old Javascript.
Imagine my devastation when I realised I would no longer enjoy the liberating developer experience that has made React so popular throughout the Javascript community… or wouldn’t I?

In this talk we won’t talk about React, but rather, about working without a framework.
We’ll explore the aspects of code writing which gift us this developer experience and how to achieve it without migrating our whole codebase.

Turns out, all we need is Vanilla. And maybe some Babel.
