# Does it test?

## Abstract
As an occasional bad sleeper I've found three things have helped me sleep well at night: Healthy eating, picking up a martial art and writing testable code.
That last one is one of the most under taught topics, and yet highly coveted skillsets, I've had to tackle on my journey as a developer.

I want to help you sleep better at night too, with the knowledge that your code is predictable, maintainable and approachable and I believe we can achieve this together by discussing what _it is_ that actually makes code *testable*.

We'll deep dive into what makes up a testable unit, how to test the integration between these units and as importantly how to prove to your boss that this isn't time wasted, nor necessarily invested, but rather time saved.
By the end of my talk you'll be so excited by the prospect of writing your next test suite, you won't manage to fall asleep.

## Pitch
I recently noticed that whenever I attend conferences and talk to participants about how I work, the number one topic that comes up is testing: How do we do TDD? How we write our tests? How we decide what to test as a unit and what to test as an integration.
This is a topic people clearly feel very strongly about, and sometimes seem to be embarrassed to ask about due to the guilty feeling of admitting that they don't actually test... often because they don't know how to.
I really want to empower people to push for cultural change at their work places, to build up confidence as they approach testing and to help them see that they aren't alone in this frustration.
This is not a talk about testing tools, it's about how to actually write code that can be tested and about using the testing process to actually write better code.
