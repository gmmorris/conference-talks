#  To async…. and beyond

## Abstract
Once upon a time there was the demonic Callback Hell, trapping us in a tangled mess of unmaintainable code, all seemed doomed… until, that is, a brave new saviour came along, armed with then and catch. The Promise, once a monstrosity of conflicting implementation, now a standard and ubiquitous built-in type, arms us with a lasso to wrangle the multi-headed Async beast.

But now a new challenger has emerged, the Observable, not a foe as much as a newer, possibly better version, a sort of Buzz Lightyear, to the Promise’s Woody. So has the time come for the Promise to retire and make way for the Observable, or does the promise still have some tricks up it’s sleeve?
Come to this talk for a tale of two paradigms, one profoundly threatened and jealous when the other threatens to supplant it as top paradigm in a developer’s toolchain.
